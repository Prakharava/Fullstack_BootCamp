    <p>“You Are Now Breathing Manually…” <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        When someone tells you this, your initial reaction is to likely try to fight the urge to think about your breath, and soon you’ll <br>
         realize that the more effort you put in to fight it i.e. the more you try to not think about thinking about your breath, the more you’re <br>
         unlikely to be successful in doing so. It’s only by completely letting go, giving up your sense of control of the breath, that you’re <br>
         able to get it to return to its natural rhythm and fade into the background of your mind. <br>
        <br>
        One of the funny things about the mind is that it doesn’t like being told what to do, despite it being the one telling it what to do. <br>
        <br>
        For the past 4 months (starting last December), I’ve been exploring this idea and the inner processes of my own mind through daily meditation.<br>
        This practice initially started as an attempt to try to calm my own mind from the sporadic thoughts that tended to cloud my daily life, <br>
        but has since developed into a daily routine that provides me so much joy and has helped build my ability to feel compassion and empathy <br>
        toward others, and ultimately learn how to live more intentionally.<br>
        <br>
        This term “meditation” gets thrown around a lot but it’s really just a fancy word for “focused awareness of what’s happening right now”. <br>
        The idea around meditation is that by focusing your mind on what’s happening right now, your mind will become clearer and calmer. <br>
        <br>
        If I may entertain you for a few minutes more, I’m going to reflect and share with you a few things that I’ve learned <br>
        and observed through this practice so far.<br>
        <h3 id="Be aware">Be Aware</h3>
        Before I started this practice, meditation to me was a foreign idea, something I thought only monks did, or certainly wasn’t for<br>
         a “regular” person like myself. I also thought meditation was <br>
         extremely difficult to do, and even if I could convince myself to <br>
         try to do it, I figured it would require considerable practice to <br>
         really get started. I’ll show you right now why all of these preconceptions were wrong.<br>
         <br>
        <h3> Breathe.</h3>

        No seriously, breathe right now. As you breathe in, feel it in your chest as your lungs fill with air. Focus on that feeling, <br>
        letting everything else fade into the background. Don’t judge that feeling, just be aware of it. Now breathe out, continuing to hold onto that feeling. <br>
        Breathe again, continuing to hold that focus. If your mind wanders, acknowledge the passing thought, and bring your focus back to the breath. Rinse & repeat.<br>
        <br>
        Congrats, you just ~meditated~<br>
        <br>
        Everything else you may hear about meditation these days: meditation pillows, meditation apps, mantras & sound bites, are only there <br>
        to try to help you create an environment that is conducive to being able to sustain that focused awareness. At the end of the day,<br>
         no matter what you do to create that mental space for yourself, don’t lose track of the real purpose of meditation: to simply be aware.<br>
        <br>
        Which leads into the next thing I’ve learned…<br>
        <h3>Be awake.</h3>
        Through the 4 months of logging my daily meditation experiences, one of the trends I noticed more than anything else was that the easiest way to<br>
         make meditation more difficult and less effective for myself was to try to do it when I’m sleepy. This isn’t to say it’s impossible, but it <br>
         certainly makes it more challenging, like trying to go to the gym in a state of physical exhaustion.<br>
        <br>
        I typically do anywhere from 10–30 minutes of meditation per day (you can do as little or as much as you like), but even that small <br>
        amount of time can seem like an eternity to your mind when you’re tired. <br>
        <br>
        One of the most effective ways that I’ve found to combat the possibility of falling asleep and to increase my awareness <br>
        is to meditate right in the morning, after a shower & a cup of joe. At that point, you should be awake enough that you aren’t going to<br>
         fall back asleep but it’s still early enough in the day that you can approach that time with a fresh, clean slate of curiosity.<br>
        <br>
        Which leads me into my third observation…<br>
